# codecoach
codecoach prototype

To work on a file, use the command:
		python codecoach.py [filename]
where [filename] is the path to the file. If multiple
arguments are provided, it will work on the last one.

The shell script "work.sh" is used to work on all the 
test scripts in the test folder. This allowed data
to be collected automatically over a large number of 
scripts.

# settings
There are a number of settings that can be adjusted for 
different outputs, debugging, etc.

In codecoach.py:
		-PRINT_OUTPUTS prints the detected smells. 
		In normal use, only this would be true.
		-PRINT_STATS prints the number of unique
		and total smells detected in the script.
		-PRINT_WHICH_SMELL_STATS prints a 1 or 0
		for each smell, depending if it was found.
		-PRINT_TREE prints the tree generated by
		pyparser.py.
		-PRINT_EXCEPTIONS toggles whether errors
		will be printed or not.
In pyinterpret.py:
		-INTERPRETER_DEBUG prints debug messages
In pyparser.py:
		-PARSER_PRINTTOKENS prints the more important
		tokens when the parser synthesizes them.
		-PARSER_DEBUG prints some error messages and
		helpful debugging messages.
		-LEXER_PRINTTOKENS prints the more important
		tokens when the lexer synthesizes them.
		-LEXER_DEBUG prints errors found by the lexer.
